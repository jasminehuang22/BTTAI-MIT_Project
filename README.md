# BTTAI-MIT_Project
A logistic regression model that was made to predict if an airbnb is instantly bookable. The data can be seen at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RCmnQj8_bhBdYZL_iRPsxoY6lEL9WEMP/view?usp=sharing . This was created after a 9 week long course on machine learning models with eCornell at MIT for the program Break Through Tech AI. NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn were used in this project. The data was preprocessed by replacing null values with the mean of all column values, columns were also winsorized for outliers and the column 'has_availability' was one-hot encoded due to its importance as a feature to the label. After the model was trained and tested with out-of-sample validation sets, X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test, the models accuracy was calculated. Afterwards, to optimize the model, different hyperparameter C's were tested to find the best one, and the most important features were found using the correlation coefficient. Afterwards, instead of using all columns in the dataset with numerical data, I used only the top 10 most important features that had the highest correlation coefficients to increase accuracy.
